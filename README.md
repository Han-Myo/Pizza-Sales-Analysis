# Insights:
* Size Demand
    * The Large (L) option clearly leads in popularity, with close to 19 k pizzas sold.
    * Medium (M) follows with roughly 15.6 k units, and Small (S) isn’t far behind at about 14.4 k units.
    * Orders for XL and XXL pizzas are rare, making up just a minor portion of overall sales.
* Best and Least Popular Pizzas
    * Best-selling pizzas like The Classic Deluxe and Barbecue Chicken contribute a significant portion of revenue.
    * A few specialty pizzas, including the Brie Carre—show minimal demand and may require a menu rethink or promotional push.
* Time Patterns
    * Sales activity peaks around midday (12–13 hours) and again in the early evening (17–19 hours).
    * Fridays and Saturdays consistently produce the highest daily totals.
    * On a monthly scale, July, May, and November emerge as the most lucrative months.

# Conclusion
* Data-driven insights highlight when and what customers buy:
    * **Staffing & Promotions:** Focus resources during lunch and dinner peaks, and plan special offers in high-demand months.
    * **Menu Optimization:** Keep top sellers well stocked; reconsider or promote low performers.
    * **Inventory Planning:** Stock more Large and Medium dough and toppings to match demand.

These findings help optimize operations, reduce waste, and improve profitability.
