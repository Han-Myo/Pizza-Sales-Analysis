# üçï Pizza Sales Analysis
This project analyzes a pizza sales dataset to uncover business insights with Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It involves cleaning and preparing the data, exploring patterns through EDA, and creating clear visualizations to highlight key operational trends.

# üîç Key Performance Indicator:
* Total revenue and quantity sold
* Total number of unique orders
* Total number of pizza types 
* Average price of the pizzas
* Peak hours of sales
* Total sales by day of week & best day
* Top 5 best-selling pizzas
* Monthly sales trends
* Lowest-selling pizzas
* Sales by pizza size (S, M, L, XL, XXL)

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
* Python: Pandas, Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

# üìà Insights:
* Size Demand
    * The Large (L) option clearly leads in popularity, with close to 19 k pizzas sold.
    * Medium (M) follows with roughly 15.6 k units, and Small (S) isn‚Äôt far behind at about 14.4 k units.
    * Orders for XL and XXL pizzas are rare, making up just a minor portion of overall sales.
* Best and Least Popular Pizzas
    * Best-selling pizzas like The Classic Deluxe and Barbecue Chicken contribute a significant portion of revenue.
    * A few specialty pizzas, including the Brie Carre‚Äîshow minimal demand and may require a menu rethink or promotional push.
* Time Patterns
    * Sales activity peaks around midday (12‚Äì13 hours) and again in the early evening (17‚Äì19 hours).
    * Fridays and Saturdays consistently produce the highest daily totals.
    * On a monthly scale, July, May, and November emerge as the most lucrative months.
 
# ‚úÖ Conclusion
* Data-driven insights highlight when and what customers buy:
    * **Staffing & Promotions:** Focus resources during lunch and dinner peaks, and plan special offers in high-demand months.
    * **Menu Optimization:** Keep top sellers well stocked; reconsider or promote low performers.
    * **Inventory Planning:** Stock more Large and Medium dough and toppings to match demand.

These findings help optimize operations, reduce waste, and improve profitability.
